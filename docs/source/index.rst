Waffle
======

.. image:: logo.png

Waffle is library for writing and testing smart contracts.

Sweeter and simpler than truffle.

Works with ethers-js. Tastes best with ES6.
(Support for TypeScript is coming).

Philosophy:
-----------
- Simpler: minimalistic, a couple of helpers, matchers and tasks rather than a framework, few dependencies.
- Sweeter: Nice syntax, fast, easy to extend.
- Faster: focus on the speed of tests execution, the goal is to have subsecond feedback loop when doing TDD with smart contracts


Versions and ethers compatibility
---------------------------------
Use version 0.2.3+ with ethers 3.* and solidity 4.*
Use version 1.0.0+ with ethers 4.* and solidity 4.*
Use version 2.0.5-beta with ethers 4.*; solidity 4, 5 and to use experimental native solc and dockerized solc.
